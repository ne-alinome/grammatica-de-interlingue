== Fix

- Footnote links don't work in the Cervantes 3 reader with the latest
  version of Asciidoctor EPUB3. They work on Calibre and fbreader
  viewers.
- Asciidoctor EPUB3 doesn't render table heading columns marked with
  `cols="h,"`.

== Improve

- Confirm "Li pòríu".
- Usar un majuscule initial in exemple-blocs con parol-listes?
- "-ie" and "-or" are duplicated, they are listed and explained in two
  sections.
- Homogenize usage of "cp.", "cf.", "v.".

== Add

- Add footnote about "yes"?
- Add footnote about "-ye"?
- Adjunter articul "Linguistic explorationes -- Pronunciation de «ch»"
  ex Cosmoglotta A 101 (1935-03).
- "córam" is missing in the list of prepositions.  
- Add annex with all of the "al-", "ne-", "-cunc" words in a table.
- Add annex with the usage of prepositions, extracted from
  Cosmoglotta.
- Add annex with lists of affixes, by type, linked to their
  description in the book.
- "for" is mentioned in "ab-" and as an interjection, but not
  explained. It's an adverb, but it's included by Matejka in his list
  of prepositions.
