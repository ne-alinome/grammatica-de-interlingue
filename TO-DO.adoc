== Fix

- Footnote links don't work in the Cervantes 3 reader with the latest
  version of Asciidoctor EPUB3. They work on Calibre and fbreader
  viewers.
- Asciidoctor EPUB3 doesn't render table heading columns marked with
  `cols="h,"`.

== Improve

- Separate all paragraph numbers from headings?
- Confirm "Li pòríu".
- Consult: "for" is mentioned in "ab-" and as an interjection, but
  it's not included in the prepositions.
- Improve notation of "y" vocalic/consonantic.
- Expand "resp."?
- Usar un majuscule initial in exemple-blocs con parol-listes?
- Link all of the affixes mentioned.
- Order "yes, no, ne...".
- Edit CSS to improve the look of the example blocks. In Asciidoctor
  EPUB3 the classes are "example" and "example-content", but the
  styles are missing from the default CSS. In the HTML output of
  Asciidoctor, the classes are "exampleblock" and "content", and the
  styles are included in the default CSS.
- Improve the notation of the list of example numbers.
- Improve the description of the programs used.

== Add

- Add footnote about "yes"?
- Add footnote about "-ye"?
- Adjunter articul ex Cosmoglotta pri pronunciation de «sh».
- Add headers to the table "Pronómines índefinit".
- "córam" is missing in the list of prepositions.  
- Add annex with all of the "al-", "ne-", "-cunc" words in a table.
- Add annex with the usage of prepositions, extracted from
  Cosmoglotta.
- Add annex with lists of affixes, by type, linked to their
  description in the book.
