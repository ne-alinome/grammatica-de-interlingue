== Fix

- Check the footnote links. They seem to fail with the latest version
  of Asciidoctor EPUB3. They work in HTML.
- Consult: r like Spanish in "radie, merce", but in Spanish "r-" and
  "-r-" are different.
- Consult: the pronunciation of "g" in English is incomplete.
- Fix: The description of "qu" in French and Spanish is ambiguous,
  because "con «u»" could mean "with the letter «u»", which they
  already have; the author meant "with an added sound of «u»".

== Improve

- Separate all paragraph numbers from headings?
- Confirm "Li pòríu".
- Consult: "for" is mentioned in "ab-" and as an interjection, but
  it's not included in the prepositions.
- Improve notation of "y" vocalic/consonantic.
- Expand "resp."?
- Usar un majuscule initial in exemple-blocs con parol-listes?
- Ameliorar explication pri li pronunciation de "y" consonantic in
  hispan.
- Separate languages with semicolon, e.g. "Apert o cludet, quam GHI,
  A: _bed, yes_, F: «é» o «è».", or "Quam AFI, G: «w».".
- Homogenize notation of pronunciation examples, e.g.   "b, d, f, I,
  m, n, p:: Quam in AFGI, H («b» in _boca_).".
- Join "p. ex." with hard spaces.
- Link all of the affixes mentioned.
- Order "yes, no, ne...".
- Fix/add reference between "-es" and "-an".
- Edit CSS to improve the look of the example blocks.
- Improve the notation of the list of example numbers.
- Improve the description of the programs used.
