- Homogenize examples in tables and lists.
- Separate all paragraph numbers from headings?
- Add URL of the Belitzky's version.
- Confirm "Li pòríu".
- Consult: "for" is mentioned in "ab-" and as an interjection, but
  it's not included in the prepositions.
- Notation: "-er-" and "-ist": "-ist-"?
- Confirm Spanish "ayustar".
- Improve notation of "y" vocalic/consonantic.
- Quote words mentioned in the text, e.g. "vice tu", "except yo e tu",
  etc.
- Consult: r like Spanish in "radie, merce", but in Spanish "r-" and
  "-r-" are different.
- Add a footnote at "un simplic s" to make clear it's about the
  plural?
- Consult: the pronunciation of "g" in English is incomplete.
