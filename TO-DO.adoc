== Fix

- Footnote links don't work in the Cervantes 3 reader with the latest
  version of Asciidoctor EPUB3. They work on Calibre and fbreader
  viewers.

== Improve

- Confirm "Li pòríu".
- Usar un majuscule initial in exemple-blocs con parol-listes?
- Homogenize usage of "cp.", "cf.", "v.".
- Description of "caus".
- In the description of "sur", the meanings "contra" and "ye li látere
  de" cannot be understood without examples. See them in the original
  list by Matejka.
- Move the original "(*)" notes to footnotes?
- Naming of the current edition: "ti edition (digital)" -> "ti-ci
  edition".

== Add

- Add footnote to "quin verbes" about aditional exceptions with
  derivates, e.g. "converter" -> "conversion".
- Add optional conversions to Markdown and HTML.
- Add footnote about "yes"?
- Add footnote about "-ye"?
- Adjunter articul "Linguistic explorationes -- Pronunciation de «ch»"
  ex Cosmoglotta A 101 (1935-03).
- Add annex with all of the "al-", "ne-", "-cunc" words in a table.
- Add annex with the usage of prepositions, extracted from
  Cosmoglotta.
- Add annex with lists of affixes, by type, linked to their
  description in the book.
- Prepositions not included: "circa", "córam", "for" (it's mentioned
  in "ab-", and also as an interjection, but not explained; it's
  mainly an adverb, but it's included by Matejka in his list of
  prepositions); "except" (included by Matejka in his list).
- Footnote about the content of §81?
- Footnote in §70 about "fe"?
- Footnote in §114 about "índirect frases" being interrogativ?
- Compare "màximum" in §8 with accentuation of "-um".
